# VibeMind PWA (v9)
- Pulled content up so actions & appointments sit neatly right under the card
- Reduced overall vertical spacing and min-height (360px) on faces
- Smaller paddings/margins across shell, card, actions, and appointments
- Cache bumped to vm-card-v9

After deploy: refresh once on the device to update the service worker.
